## Hi ( •̀ ◡ •́ )✧

I am a PhD student in [Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park]((https://www.cs.umd.edu/)), working with [Prof. Pratap Tokekar](https://tokekar.com/). My current research interset mainly focuses on Robotics and Reinforcement Learning.

Prior to that, I was a master's student in [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/) at [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/main.htm), co-supervised by Prof. [Jingyi Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R9L_AfQAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Laurent Kneip](http://www.laurentkneip.com/). I obtained my bachelor’s degree in School of Computer Engineering and Science at [Shanghai University](http://www.shu.edu.cn/)
