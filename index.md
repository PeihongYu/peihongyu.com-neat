## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), working with [Prof. Pratap Tokekar](https://tokekar.com/). 

I currently work in the field of Reinforcement Learning, mostly Multi-Agent RL. The core of my work is to address the challenges of training efficiency and generalizability, allowing autonomous agents to learn effectively and perform robustly across diverse scenarios.

Prior to that, I was a master's student in [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/) at [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/main.htm), co-supervised by Prof. [Jingyi Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R9L_AfQAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Laurent Kneip](http://www.laurentkneip.com/), working on SLAM and 3D Reconstruction.
