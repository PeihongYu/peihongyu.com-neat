## About Me

I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at XPeng, where I work on reinforcement learning for end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Pratap Tokekar](https://tokekar.com/). My research focused on Reinforcement Learning, particularly Multi-Agent RL, addressing fundamental challenges in training efficiency and generalizability. 

Prior to that, I earned my Master's degree from [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/main.htm), where I worked on SLAM and 3D Reconstruction with Prof. [Jingyi Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R9L_AfQAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Laurent Kneip](http://www.laurentkneip.com/).
